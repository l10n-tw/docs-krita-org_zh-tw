"The clone brush is a brush engine that allows you to paint with a "
"duplication of a section of a paint-layer. This is useful in manipulation of "
"photos and textures. You have to select a source and then you can paint to "
"copy or clone the source to a different area. Other applications normally "
"have a separate tool for this, Krita has a brush engine for this."
