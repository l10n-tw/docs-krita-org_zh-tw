"So you've got a cool black on white drawing, and now you want to color it! "
"The thing we’ll aim for in this tutorial is to get your line art colored in "
"with flat colors. So no shading just yet. We’ll be going through some "
"techniques for preparing the line art, and we’ll be using the layer docker "
"to put each color on a separate layer, so we can easily access each color "
"when we add shading."

"This is referred to as the “drawing order”. So like the traditional artist, "
"the computer will first draw the images that are behind everything, and "
