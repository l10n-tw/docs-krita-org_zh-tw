"Sometimes especially in the field of game development, artists need to work "
"with the alpha channel of the texture separately. To assist such workflow, "
"Krita has a special functionality called :menuselection:`Split Alpha`. It "
"allows splitting alpha channel of a paint layer into a separate :ref:"
"`transparency_masks`. The artist can work on the transparency mask in an "
"isolated environment and merge it back when he has finished working."

"Normally, when saving an image to a file, all fully transparent areas of the "

"layers of the image, Krita drop color data of fully transparent pixels for "
"efficiency reason. To avoid this of color data loss you can either avoid "
"compositing of the image i.e. limit image to only one layer without any "
"masks or effects, or use the following method:"
