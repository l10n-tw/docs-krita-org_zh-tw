"Krita's default saving format is the :ref:`file_kra` format. This format "
"saves everything Krita can manipulate about an image: Layers, Filters, "
"Assistants, Masks, Color spaces, etc. However, that's a lot of data, so ``*."
"kra`` files are pretty big. This doesn't make them very good for uploading "
"to the internet. Imagine how many people's data-plans hit the limit if they "
"only could look at ``*.kra`` files! So instead, we optimise our images for "
"the web."

"Flatten all layers. This turns all your layers into a single one. Just go "
"to :menuselection:`Layer --> Flatten Image` or press the :kbd:`Ctrl + Shift "
"+ E` shortcut. Flattening can take a while, so if you have a big image, "
"don't be scared if Krita freezes for a few seconds. It'll become responsive "
"soon enough."

"Convert the color space to 8bit sRGB (if it isn't yet). This is important to "
"lower the filesize, and PNG for example can't take higher than 16bit. :"
"menuselection:`Image --> Convert Image Color Space...` and set the options "
"to **RGB**, **8bit** and **sRGB-elle-v2-srgbtrc.icc** respectively. If you "
"are coming from a linear space, uncheck **little CMS** optimisations"

"Resize! Go to :menuselection:`Image --> Scale Image To New Size...` or use "
"the :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt + I` shortcut. This calls up the resize menu. A good "
"rule of thumb for resizing is that you try to get both sizes to be less than "
"1200 pixels. (This being the size of HD formats). You can easily get there "
"by setting the **Resolution** under **Print Size** to **72** dots per inch. "
"Then press **OK** to have everything resized."

"Sharpen the image a little. This is especially necessary for social media. "
"Social media websites often scale and convert your image in such a way that "
"it gets a little blurry, because they optimize towards photos and not "
"paintings. To have your images stay sharp, it is worth it to run a sharpen "
"filter beforehand. Because the sharpen filter is quite powerful, you are "
"best off adding a sharpen filter mask on top of the stack and lowering its "
"opacity till you feel the sharpness is appropriate."
