"Since 4.2 Krita can not just edit high bitdepths images, but also render "
"them on screen in a way that an HDR capable setup can show them as HDR "
"images. HDR images, to put it simply, are images with really bright colors. "
"They do this by having a very large range of colors available, 16 bit and "
"higher, and to understand the upper range of the available colors as "
"brighter than the brightest white most screens can show. HDR screens, in "
"turn, are screens which can show brighter colors than most screens can show, "
"and can thus show the super-bright colors in these HDR images. This allows "
"for images where bright things, like fire, sunsets, magic, look really "
"spectacular! It also shows more subtle shadows and has a better contrast in "
"lower color values, but this requires a sharper eye."

"Krita cannot show HDR with any given monitor, you will need an HDR capable "
"setup. HDR capable setups are screens which can show more than 100 nits, "
"preferably a value like 1000 and can show the rec 2020 PQ space. You will "
"need to have the appropriate display cable(otherwise the values are just "
"turned into regular SDR) and a graphics card which supports HDR, as well as "
"suitable drivers. You then also need to configure the system settings for "
"HDR."

"in :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure Krita... --> Display`. There, you "
"need to select the preferred surface, which should be as close to the "
"display format as possible. Then restart Krita."
