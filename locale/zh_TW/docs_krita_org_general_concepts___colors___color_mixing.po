"Much like physical media, there are many ways to mix colors together in "
"Krita. Traditional painters and illustrators often use techniques like "
"**glazing**, **scumbling**, and **hatching** to mix colors directly on their "
"canvas, on top of mixing colors together on a **palette** or even within the "
"hairs of their **brush**. With a little bit of practice and know-how, and "
"thanks to the variety of powerful tools in Krita, we can mimic all of these "
"mixing techniques in digital painting."

"In both traditional and digital painting, mixing techniques can be divided "

msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:26
msgid ""
"On-canvas mixing techniques are ones where multiple colors are combined "
"directly on the canvas as the artist paints. This takes a few forms, "
"including **layering semi-transparent color** on top of another color, using "
"**texture** to change how a color is perceived, or even in the interaction "
"between two areas of wet paint in traditional media. Bottom line: on-canvas "
"mixing happens right on the canvas and is a great tool for artistic "
"exploration and \"happy accidents\"."

msgid "Glazing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:35
msgid ""
"In traditional painting, **glazing** is overlaying many different semi-"
"transparent layers to create on-canvas color mixtures. Likewise, in digital "
"painting we can also use glazing to mix colors directly on our canvas. This "
"is one of the most fundamental and commonly used mixing techniques in "
"digital painting."
msgstr ""

"We first lay down a semi-transparent layer on top of another color that we "
"intend to mix with. Then, we pick the **resultant color** with the :kbd:"
"`Ctrl +` |mouseleft| shortcut (this can be configured in the canvas input "
"settings), and paint with that. Depending on our brush's **opacity "
"setting**, each time we glaze one color over another we will get a color "
"that is somewhere between those two colors, often leading to a nice mixture."

"We can mix even more easily with glazing when we set our brush's **flow** to "
"a lower setting. Subtly different than opacity, :ref:`flow "
"<option_opacity_n_flow>` is transparency per dab instead of stroke, and so "
"it gives us softer strokes without giving up control."
msgstr ""

"Furthermore, we can combine glazing with various **blending modes** to "
"achieve different, interesting effects. For example, glazing with the "

"Then, using a brush with low flow (~0.30), we can pick the resulting colors "

"**Smudge mixing** is done with the :ref:`color_smudge_brush_engine`, a "

msgid ""
"**Off-canvas** mixing has basically always been a core tool for artists "
"everywhere; when we think of the stereotypical artist we might imagine "
"someone with a few **brushes** in one hand and a wooden **palette** in the "
"other. Whether it's oils, watercolor, or other traditional media, for the "
"artist to have absolute control over their colors it's crucial to have some "
"kind of palette, plate, jar, or other **off-canvas area** to mix colors "
"together. While it's easy to overlook this in digital painting (where "
"selecting fresh new colors without mixing at all is both easy and free), "
"Krita has a few very useful and unique features for off-canvas mixing."

msgid ""
"Krita, like almost every art and graphics program, has a :ref:"
"`color_sampler_tool` which allows you to very quickly sample a color from "
"any pixel on your canvas. While this tool may seem relatively simple and "
"humble, it is also one of the most important and commonly used tools in the "
"digital artist's toolbox - perhaps only second to the brush! In fact, the "
"color sampler tool is at the very heart of mixing colors, and is often used "
"in combination with on-canvas techniques like glazing and scumbling to "
"produce smooth blends of color."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:111
msgid ""
"And still, there is more to this little tool than meets the eye! Not only "
"can you configure Krita's color sampler to sample from the average color of "
"a **radius** of pixels, Krita's Color Sampler also has a unique **blending** "
"feature: a powerful and intuitive tool for off-canvas color mixing!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:117
msgid ""
"The Color Sampler Blending feature changes the way that picking colors has "
"traditionally worked for decades; instead of completely replacing your "
"current brush color with the newly sampled color, *blending allows you to "
"quickly \"soak up\" some portion of the sampled color*, which is then mixed "
"with your current brush color."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:119
msgid ""
"You can use Color Sampler Blending much like a physical paint brush in "
"traditional media. If you were to dip your paint brush into a pool of *blue* "
"paint, and then immediately dip again into a pool of *red* paint and paint a "
"stroke across your canvas, the stoke wouldn't be pure red - it would be some "
"combination of blue and red which would mix to create an intermediate purple "
"color. Which shade of purple would depend on the ratio of paints that mix "
"together within the hairs of your brush, and this is essentially what the "
"Color Sampler's \"blend\" option controls: what percentage of sampled color "
"is mixed together with your current brush color!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:121
msgid ""
"Not only does Krita's Color Sampler Blending feel even more like mixing "
"paints, it is also completely off-canvas and independent of opacity, flow, "
"shape, and other brush settings. Furthermore, unlike most on-canvas mixing "
"techniques, Color Sampler Blending works regardless of the location of "
"colors on your canvas - enabling you to mix with colors at any position, on "
"any layer, or even in different documents! Quickly mix lighting colors with "
"local colors, mix the ambient sky color into shadows, create atmospheric "
"depth, mix from a preselected palette of colors in another layer/document, "
"etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:123
msgid ""
"To use Color Sampler Blending, simply set the \"blend\" option in the **Tool "
"Options Docker** while the Color Sampler Tool is active; setting blend to "
"100% will cause your Color Sampler to work in the traditional way "
"(completely replacing your brush color with the picked color), setting to "
"around 50% will give you a half-way mix between colors, and setting to a "
"lower value will create more subtle shifts in colors each click. Of course, "
"blending affects both your dedicated Color Sampler Tool as well as the :kbd:"
"`Ctrl +` |mouseleft| shortcut."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:127
msgid ""
"Clicking and dragging the Color Sampler around the canvas currently causes "
"it to sample many times as it switches pixels. You can use this trait to "
"quickly soak up more color by \"dipping\" your color sampler into color and "
"swirling it around. This can be pretty satisfying! However, this also means "
"that some care must be taken to prevent from accidentally picking up more "
"color than you want. It's pretty easy to click a single pixel only one time "
"using a **mouse**, but when painting with a **drawing tablet and pen** it "
"can sometimes be desirable to use a slightly lower blend setting!"

"Somewhat hidden away in the **Dockers** menu (:menuselection:`Settings --> "
"Dockers --> Digital Colors Mixer`), this can be a useful tool for off-canvas "
"mixing. The Digital Colors Mixer looks a little bit like an audio mixing "
"board that you'd see in a recording studio, but instead of mixing music it "
"mixes colors! It contains 6 independent **color mixers** that mix your "
"current brush color with any color of your choosing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By clicking the **color buttons** below each mixer you can choose a palette "
"of colors to mix with. Above each mixer is a **color patch** that will "
"produce a color that mixes some amount of your current brush color with the "
"palette color. Colors towards the top of the mixer will deliver subtle "
"changes to your current color, while colors towards the bottom will be much "
"closer to the palette color of that channel."

"Outside of making it easier to create smooth gradients, mixing has another "
"benefit: It allows you to create a cohesive piece."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:145
msgid ""
"Limiting the number of colors we use and then mixing tends to give a more "
"cohesive palette, as we're not trying to do too much at once. This cohesive "
"palette in turn means it will become easier to create a certain mood in an "
"image. Sometimes, mixing in a little bit of accent color can also create "
"unexpected results which in turn can be a little discovery for the audience "
"to delight over as they discover the world of your image."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What we can learn from this, is that the next time we select, say, gray, "
"instead of reaching for a random or generic gray from the Advanced Color "
"Selector, consider using one of Krita's many wonderful mixing tools to "
"create an interesting and fitting gray from hues that are roughly "
"complementary (opposite each other on the hue wheel)."

"While on-canvas and off-canvas techniques are fundamentally different "
"categories of mixing colors, they are not mutually exclusive. All of the "
"mixing methods in this article have pros and cons; different tools can be "
"useful for different situations, and combining various techniques can be "
"extremely powerful and fun!"

"Finally, mixing colors will often go far better in a :ref:`higher bit-depth "
"like 16bit <bit_depth>`, though it'll make the image take up much more "
"working **memory** (RAM). Furthermore, using a :ref:`linear color space "
"<linear_and_gamma>` can often give far better mixtures than a **gamma-"
"corrected** one, though doing sketches and line art is easier to do in a "
"gamma-corrected space."
