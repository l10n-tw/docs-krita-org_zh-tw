":program:`Krita`, as a painting program, juggles a lot of data around, like "
"the brushes you use, the colors you picked, but primarily, each pixel in "
"your image. Due to this, how :program:`Krita` organizes where it stores all "
"the data can really speed up :program:`Krita` while painting, just like "
"having an organized artist's workplace can really speed up the painting "
"process in real life."

"RAM, or Random Access Memory, is the memory your computer is immediately "
"using. The difference between RAM and the hard drive memory can be compared "
"to the difference between having files on your desk and having files safely "
"stored away in an archiving room: The files on your desk as much easier to "
"access than the ones in your archive, and it takes time to pull new files "
"from the archive. This is the same for your computer and RAM. Files need to "
"be loaded into RAM before the computer can really use them, and storing and "
"removing them from RAM takes time."

msgid ""
"A feature for advanced computer users. This allows :program:`Krita` to "
"organize the area it takes up on the virtual working desk before putting its "
"data on there. Like how a painter has a standard spot for their canvas, :"
"program:`Krita` also benefits from giving certain data it uses its place (a "
"memory pool), so that it can find them easily, and it doesn't get lost among "
"the other data (memory fragmentation). It will then also not have to spend "
"time finding a spot for this data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/preferences/performance_settings.rst:34
msgid ""
"Increasing this, of course, means there's more space for this type of data, "
"but like how filling up your working desk with only one big canvas will make "
"it difficult to find room for your paints and brushes, having a large "
"internal pool will result in :program:`Krita` not knowing where to put the "
"other non-specific data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/preferences/performance_settings.rst:36
msgid ""
"On the opposite end, not giving your canvas a spot at all, will result in "
"you spending more time looking for a place where you will put the new layer "

":program:`Krita` also needs to keep all the Undo states on the virtual desk "
"(RAM). Swapping means that parts of the files on the virtual desk get sent "
"to the virtual archive room. This allows :program:`Krita` to dedicate more "
"RAM space to new actions, by sending old Undo states to the archive room "
"once it hits this limit. This will make undoing a little slower, but this "
"can be desirable for the performance of :program:`Krita` overall. This too "

"Playing back a video at 25 FPS means that the computer has to precalculate "
"25 images per second of video. Now, video playing software is able to do "
"this because it really focuses on this one single task. However, Krita as a "
"painting program also allows you to edit the pictures. Because Krita needs "
"to be able to do this, and a dedicated video player doesn't, Krita cannot do "
"the same kind of optimizations as a dedicated video player can."

msgid ""
"Still, an animator does need to be able to see what kind of animation they "
"are making. To do this properly, we need to decide how Krita will regenerate "
"the cache after the animator makes a change. There's fortunately a lot of "
"different options how we can do this. However, the best solution really "
"depends on what kind of computer you have and what kind of animation you are "
"making. Therefore in this tab you can customize the way how and when the "
