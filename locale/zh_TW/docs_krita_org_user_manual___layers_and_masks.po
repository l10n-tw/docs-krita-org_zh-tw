"Think of an artwork or collage made with various stacks of papers with some "
"papers cut such that they show the paper beneath them while some hide what's "
"beneath them. If you want to replace an element in the artwork, you replace "
"that piece of paper instead of drawing the entire thing. In Krita instead of "
"papers we use :dfn:`Layers`. Layers are part of the document which may or "
"may not be transparent, they may be smaller or bigger than the document "
"itself, they can arrange one above other, named and grouped."

"You can edit individual layers, you can even add special effects to them, "
"like Layer styles, blending modes, transparency, filters and transforms. "
"Krita takes all these layers in its layer stack, including the special "
"effects and combines or composites together a final image. This is just one "
"of the many digital image manipulation tricks that :program:`Krita` has up "
"its sleeve!"

"In Krita, the visible layers form a composite image which is shown on the "

"added layers on top."

"Group Layers composite separately from the other layers in the stack, except "
"when pass through mode is activated. The layers inside a group form a "
"composite image first and then this composite is taken into consideration "
"while the layer stack is composited to form a whole image. If the pass "
"through mode is activated by pressing the icon similar to bricked wall, the "
"layers within the group are considered as if they are outside that "
"particular group in the layer stack, however, the visibility of the layers "
"in a group depends on the visibility of the group."

"There is a clipping feature in Krita called inherit alpha. It is denoted by "
"an alpha icon in the layer stack."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/layers_and_masks.rst:89
msgid ""
"It can be somewhat hard to figure out how the :dfn:`inherit alpha` feature "
"works in Krita for the first time. Once you click on the inherit alpha icon "
"on the layer stack, the pixels of the layer you are painting on are confined "
"to the combined pixel area of all the layers below it. That means if you "
"have the default white background layer as first layer, clicking on the "
"inherit alpha icon and painting on any layer above will seem to have no "
"effect as the entire canvas is filled with white. Hence, it is advised to "
"put the base layer that you want the pixels to clip in a group layer. As "
"mentioned above, group layers are composited separately, hence the layer "
"which is the lowest layer in a group becomes the bounding layer and the "
"content of the layers above this layer clips to it if inherit alpha is "
"enabled."

"Krita supports non-destructive editing of the content of the layer. Non-"
"destructive editing means editing or changing a layer or image without "
"actually changing the original source image permanently, the changes are "
"just added as filters or masks over the original image while keeping it "
"intact, this helps a lot when your workflow requires constant back and "
"forth. You can go back to original image with a click of a button. Just hide "
"the filter or mask you have your initial image."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/layers_and_masks.rst:102
msgid ""
"You can add various filters to a layer with Filter mask, or add Filter layer "
"which will affect the whole image. Layers can also be transformed non-"
"destructively with the transformation masks, and even have portions "
"temporarily hidden with a Transparent Mask. Non-destructive effects like "
"these are very useful when you change your mind later, or need to make a set "
"of variations of a given image."
