"A fill layer based on de Bruijn's 1981 multigrid method to generate `Penrose "
"Tilings <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling>`_ . This generator "
"projects a hyperdimensional grid lattice onto a 2d plane, giving some pretty "
"cool patterns. Besides looking cool, there's a few interesting and "
"potentially useful features the resulting patterns have:"
