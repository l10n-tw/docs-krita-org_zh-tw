"So, usually what we mean by viewing conditions is the lighting and "
"decoration of the room that you are viewing the image in. Our eyes try to "
"make sense of both the colors that you are looking at actively (the colors "
"of the image) and the colors you aren't looking at actively (the colors of "
"the room), which means that both sets of colors affect how the image looks."

"**Left**: Let's ruin Vermeer by putting a bright purple background that asks "
"for more attention than the famous painting itself. **Center**: a much more "
"neutral backdrop that an interior decorator would hate but brings out the "
"colors. **Right**: The approximate color that this painting is displayed "
"against in real life in the Maurits House, at the least, last time I was "
"there. Original image from wikipedia commons."

"This is for example, the reason why museum exhibitioners can get really "
"angry at the interior decorators when the walls of the museum are painted "
"bright red or blue, because this will drastically change the way how the "
"painting's colors look. (Which, if we are talking about a painter known for "
"their colors like Vermeer, could result in a really bad experience)."

"Lighting is the other component of the viewing condition which can have "
"dramatic effects. Lighting in particular affects the way how all colors "
"look. For example, if you were to paint an image of sunflowers and poppies, "
"print that out, and shine a bright yellow light on it, the sunflowers would "
"become indistinguishable from the white background, and the poppies would "
"look orange. This is called `metamerism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Metamerism_%28color%29>`_, and it's generally something you want to avoid in "
"your color management pipeline."

"An example where metamerism could become a problem is when you start "

"For example, if you are designing a print for a red t-shirt that's not "
"bright red, but not super grayish red either. And you want to make sure the "
"colors of the print match the color of the t-shirt, so you make a dummy "
"background layer that is approximately that red, as correctly as you can "
"observe it, and paint on layers above that dummy layer. When you are done, "
"you hide this dummy layer and sent the image with a transparent background "
"to the press."

"But when you get the t-shirt from the printer, you notice that all your "
"colors look off, mismatched, and maybe too yellowish (and when did that T-"
"Shirt become purple?)."

"You probably observed the t-shirt in a white room where there were "
"incandescent lamps shining, because as a true artist, you started your work "
"in the middle of the night, as that is when the best art is made. However, "
"incandescent lamps have a black body temperature of roughly 2300-2800K, "
"which makes them give a yellowish light, officially called White Point A."

"Your computer screen on the other hand, has a black body temperature of "
"6500K, also known as D65. Which is a far more blueish color of light than "
"the lamps you are hanging."

"What's worse, Printers print on the basis of using a white point of D50, the "
"color of white paper under direct sunlight."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So, by eye-balling your t-shirt's color during the evening, you took its red "
"color as transformed by the yellowish light. Had you made your observation "
"in diffuse sunlight of an overcast (which is also roughly D65), or made it "
"in direct sunlight light and painted your picture with a profile set to D50, "
"the color would have been much closer, and thus your design would not be as "
"yellowish."

"Applying a white balance filter will sort of match the colors to the tone as "
"in the middle, but you would have had a much better design had you designed "
"against the actual color to begin with."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/viewing_conditions.rst:79
msgid ""
"Now, you could technically quickly fix this by using a white balancing "
"filter, like the ones in G'MIC, but because this error is caught at the end "
"of the production process, you basically limited your use of possible colors "
"when you were designing, which is a pity."

"We have a presentation where we mark one type of item with red, another with "
"yellow and yet another with purple. On a computer the differences between "
"the colors are very obvious."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, when we start projecting, the lights of the room aren't dimmed, "
"which means that the tone scale of the colors becomes crunched, and yellow "
"becomes near indistinguishable from white. Furthermore, because the light in "
"the room is slightly yellowish, the purple is transformed into red, making "
"it indistinguishable from the red. Meaning that the graphic is difficult to "
"read."

"In both cases, you can use Krita's color management a little to help you, "
"but mostly, you just need to be ''aware'' of it, as Krita can hardly fix "
"that you are looking at colors at night, or the fact that the presentation "
"hall owner refuses to turn off the lights."

"That said, unless you have a display profile that uses LUTs, such as an OCIO "
"LUT or a cLUT ICC profile, white point won't matter much when choosing a "
"working space, due to weirdness in the ICC v4 workflow which always converts "
"matrix profiles with relative colorimetric, meaning the white points are "
"matched up."
