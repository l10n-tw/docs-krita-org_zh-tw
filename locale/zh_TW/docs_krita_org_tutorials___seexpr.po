"To understand what SeExpr is about, we need to differentiate between two "
"types of graphics, *raster* and *procedural*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/seexpr.rst:44
msgid ""
"The vast majority of the computer-generated stuff you see every day belong "
"to the first type-- images like photos, your favorite anime screenshots, "
"memes, are all a multitude of tiny little dots of color, or *pixels*, "

"Raster graphics have two drawbacks. First, once you create them, their "
"resolution is **fixed**. You cannot zoom in and magically get any more "
"detail. And if you need to change them, either you go back to the source and "
"sample it again (which is sometimes impossible), or edit it with a raster "
"graphics program, like Krita."

"One of the biggest problems, however, is that we are always limited by the "
"**space** our programs can use; either secondary storage, like SD cards, or "
"RAM. Unless compressed, image memory needs are `quadratic in the size of the "

"SeExpr belongs to a different class, *procedural graphics*. Similar to "
"vector graphics, procedural graphics only need a few KBs of secondary "

"formulae; you actually *code* how the color is calculated at each point of "
