"Selections allow you to pick a specific area of your artwork to change. This "
"is useful when you want to move a section of the painting, transform it, or "
"paint on it without affecting the other sections. There are many selection "
"tools available that select in different ways. Once an area is selected, "
"most tools will stay inside that area. On that area you can draw or use "
"gradients to quickly get colored and/or shaded shapes with hard edges. The "
"selections in Krita are not limited to the canvas boundary, so you can also "
"selection portions of the painting that are beyond the canvas boundary."
