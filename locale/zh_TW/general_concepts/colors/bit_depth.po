"1, 2, and 3bit per channel don't actually exist in any graphics application "

"One step up from 8bit, 16bit per channel allows for colors that can't be "

"Similar to 16bit, but with more range and less precision. Where 16bit only "
"allows coordinates like [1, 4, 3], 16bit float has coordinates like [0.15, "
"0.70, 0.3759], with [1.0,1.0,1.0] representing white. Because of the "
"differences between floating point and integer type variables, and because "
"Scene-referred imaging allows for negative values, you have about 10-11bits "
"of precision per channel in 16 bit floating point compared to 16 bit in 16 "
"bit int (this is 2048 values per channel in the 0-1 range). Required for HDR/"
"Scene referred images, and often known as 'half floating point'."

"Similar to 16bit float but with even higher precision. The native color "
"depth of OpenColor IO, and thus faster than 16bit float in HDR images, if "
"not heavier. Because of the nature of floating point type variables, 32bit "
"float is roughly equal to 23-24 bits of precision per channel (16777216 "
"values per channel in the 0-1 range), but with a much wider range (it can go "
"far above 1), necessary for HDR/Scene-referred values. It is also known as "
"'single floating point'."

"And while you can attempt to create all your images a 32bit float, this will "
