msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:40
msgid ""
"The :ref:`timeline_docker`. View and control all the frames in your "

"layers. The layers that are created in the timeline docker also appear on "
"the normal Layer docker."

"The :ref:`storyboard_docker`. This docker helps you create and keep track of "

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:45
msgid ""
"Furthermore, especially when you want to do a big animation, that is, any "
"animation longer than 3 seconds, you will need to think about how you are "
"going to approach this. Krita is specialized in :dfn:`frame by frame "
"animation`, and because of this Krita keeps all the frames in memory. This "
"means that animation files will eat up all of your computer's working memory "
"(RAM). If you don't know what working memory is, you probably have too "
"little to do a long sequence in Krita. Therefore, you need to take a page "
"from professional animation and do some planning!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:49
msgid "The storyboard docker can help you plan out the shots of a scene."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:51
msgid ""
"Typically, most animation projects start with a script or at the very least "
"an outline of actions that will happen. You can do this in any kind of text "
"editor you like. The next step is to create a :ref:`storyboard "
"<storyboard_docker>`. They are sketches of the basic composition of each "
"scene, with some extra notes on what is going to move, like camera movement, "
"character movement, notes on audio, notes on color. These seem closer to a "
"comic than an animation, but the key difference between the two is that in "
"comics the composition is made to help the reader move their eyes over the "
"page, while in animation the viewer's eyes will stay in relatively the same "
"spot, so consecutive storyboard frames will have their most important "
"elements in relatively the same place. If that seems a little abstract, "
"don't worry. You can make a story board by using the animation functions, "
"but the key here is that you use as little frames as possible. Export the "
"story board using the render animation option."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:53
msgid ""
"Then, the next step is to make an :dfn:`Animatic`. An animatic is basically "
"the storyboard, but then animated. You are best off doing this in a video "
"editor like `Kdenlive <http://kdenlive.org/>`_, `OpenShot <https://www."
"openshot.org/>`_, `Olive <https://olivevideoeditor.org/index.php>`_, or even "
"Windows Movie Maker. *If you want to put everything together into one big "
"animation you will need to learn how to use such a program to begin with, as "
"Krita doesn't have extensive video and audio montage functions.*"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:55
msgid ""
"Doing the animatic will allow you to see how the animation can be subdivided "
"into small clips. If you are just starting out, you are best off limiting "
"yourself to 12 frames per second. Then, a 10-second clip would be 120 "
"frames. Try to figure out if you can subdivide your animation idea into "
"clips of 10 seconds or shorter. You can import the story board frames "
"associated with a specific clip by going to :menuselection:`File --> Import "
"Animation Frames`. From there, slowly start building up your animation. "
"During the sketching phase it may also help to work on a low resolution, "
"like 800×450 pixels. High resolution only starts mattering when you are "
"doing line art, after all. And it will be hard to get to that point if you "
"don't even have a rough outline."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:57
msgid ""
"Always keep an eye on the memory consumption. You can see the memory "
"consumption in the status bar, by clicking the resolution label. This label "
"should also have a little progress bar that shows how much memory Krita is "
"using at this moment. Don't let the memory bar get full: it will lead to "
"Krita slowing down, and sometimes it might even mean Krita won't be able to "
"export the animation on your specific machine. You can reduce memory "
"consumption by:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:59
msgid ""
"Merging together layers. Yes, you cannot afford to have a layer for every "
"single change. Often, the fewer layers, the better."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:60
msgid ""
"In some cases by going to :menuselection:`Image --> Crop Layers to Image "
"Size`, this will crop all layers to remove sections that are outside the "
"canvas."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:61
msgid ""
"Sometimes, certain layers don't need to be full color, especially if they're "
"just black and white. You can then go to :menuselection:`Layers --> Convert "
"--> Convert Layer Color Space` and convert the layer to a grayscale one. "
"This will half the amount of RAM this specific layer will take up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:62
msgid ""
"Working smaller. Even if you imagined yourself animating in the 4K "
"resolution, you might need to accept your computer just cannot handle this. "
"Try going a step lower, on animations, even a 20% reduction can make a huge "
"difference in memory consumption, while not being a huge difference in "
"resolution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:64
msgid ""
"Also watch out that other programs on your computer aren't hogging all the "
"RAM. Web browsers and chat programs tend to be the biggest culprits here, "
"especially if you are streaming music or videos. If you are hurting for "
"memory, see if you can get these functions to work on a separate device like "
"a phone instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:66
msgid ""
"Another thing you will want to do is make a ton of backups. Every time you "
"hit an important section with an animation, like you finished the line art, "
"or you did a pretty tricky section, you will want to use :menuselection:"
"`File --> Incremental Backup` to make a separate copy of the current file to "
"continue working in. This way, if the animation file gets corrupt, which "
"could happen due to a power outage, or a cat jumping on the keyboard, you "
"will still have a snapshot of the last important section. Other backup "
"techniques, like copying the files to a cloud service, or to a backup hard "
"drive are also very recommended."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/animation.rst:70
msgid ""
"And while we're at it, whenever you've hit a milestone, don't forget to take "
