"Krita's main goal is to help artists create a digital painting from scratch. "
"Krita is used by comic artists, matte painters, texture artists, and "
"illustrators around the world. This section explains some common workflow "
"that artists use in Krita. When you open a new document in Krita for the "
"first time, you can start painting instantly. The brush tool is selected by "
"default and you just have to paint on the canvas. However, let us look at "
"what artists do in Krita. Below are some of the common workflows used in "
"Krita:"

"Some artists work only on the digital medium, sketching and visualizing "
"concepts in Krita from scratch. As the name suggests a technique of painting "
"done within a matter of hours to quickly visualize the basic scene, "
"character, look and feel of the environment or to denote the general mood "
"and overall concept is called a **speed painting**. Finishing and finer "
"details are not the main goals of this type of painting, but the "
"representation of form value and layout is the main goal."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/common_workflows.rst:24
msgid ""
"Some artists set a time limit to complete the painting while some paint "
"casually. Speed painting then can be taken forward by adding finer details "
"and polish to create a final piece. Generally, artists first block in the "
"composition by adding patches and blobs of flat colors, defining the "
"silhouette, etc. Krita has some efficient brushes for this situation, for "
"example, the brushes under **Block Tag** like Block fuzzy, Block basic, "
"layout_block, etc."

"After the composition and a basic layout has been laid out the artists add "
