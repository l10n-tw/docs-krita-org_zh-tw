"Krita does not store your images somewhere without your intervention. You "
"need to save your work, or it will be lost, irretrievably. Krita can save "
"your images in many formats. You should always save your work in Krita's "
"native format, ``.kra`` because that supports all Krita's features."

"Additionally, you can export your work to other formats, for compatibility "
"with other applications or publication on the Web or on paper. Krita will "
