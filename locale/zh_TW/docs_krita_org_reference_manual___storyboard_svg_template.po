"The simplest of those are the procedural layout options, such as \"rows\", "
"\"columns\", and \"grid\" modes. Using these modes, Krita can generate a "

"However, for the highest level of control and the best aesthetics, the "

"While it's perfectly possible to write one of these SVG template files by "

"open source program that you can use to create vector art, design logos, and "

"Next, we need to create a few specific layers (*background*, *layout*, and "
"*overlay*) that Krita will recognize and use to draw our page correctly. The "
"\"background\" and \"overlay\" layers are relatively simple: anything that "
"belongs to the \"background\" layer will be drawn underneath the storyboard "
"elements (the images, comments and other metadata), and anything that "
"belongs to the \"overlay\" layer will be drawn on top of the storyboard "
"elements. Whether you should use these layers in your own storyboard export "
"template depends on your own needs and how you design your sheet. Finally, "
"the \"layout\" layer is where we will be placing the various rectangles that "
"we will use to tell Krita exactly where we want our storyboard elements to "
"appear. We'll run through that process in detail later, but first we need to "
"get the layers set up correctly."

"As of the time of writing this, Inkscape makes it slightly complicated to "
"change the ID of our layers. First we need to open Inkscape's :guilabel:"
"`Object > Objects...` panel, where we can see all of our layers, groups, and "
"other SVG objects. Click on the :guilabel:`+` and create a layer called "
"\"background\", then again with the name \"layout\", and finally another one "

msgid ""
"**This next part is important!** You should have 3 layers now, but because "
"we use the :guilabel:`ID` attribute of the SVG object, we have to do a "
"little bit more work to make sure that Krita will recognize our layers. If "
"you select your layer and open Inkscape's :guilabel:`Object > Object "
"Properties...` panel, you will see that everything is grayed out and we are "
"not able to change the \"ID\" parameter! Here's how to get around that: "
"first, we have to *convert our layers into groups* by clicking on the icon "
"in the :guilabel:`T` column on Inkscape's :guilabel:`Objects...` panel. Once "
"all three of our layers are groups, we can open the :guilabel:`Object "

"Ok, that was a bit more complicated that we wanted it to be, but it's all "
"downhill from here! If you run into problems creating your template, it's "
"probably going to be some part of that last step that's to blame, so it's "
"worth double-checking that each of your layers has the correct ID. (By the "
"way, the ID can also be edited manually using a text editor, but that's "
"probably out of the scope of this tutorial.)"

"At this point you have the option of adding whatever visual design elements "

"then I recommend putting it into the \"background\" layer, and if you want "
"to overlay some panels or text, I recommend adding them to the \"overlay\" "
"layer. Just remember, everything in the \"background\" layer will be "

"As of Inkscape 1.1, new objects are automatically added to the layer that "

"wrong place in Krita and other programs! I don't know why this happens or "
"how to fix it, but I *do* know how to work around it. If you use text "
"elements and you run into problems with them not showing up where they're "

"Krita will use the rectangles that you place into this layer to determine "

"For organizational reasons I like to color code each rectangle by type (for "

msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/storyboard_svg_template.rst:113

"It doesn't really matter how you arrive at the final result, but I think a "
"good way of doing this quickly is to place rectangles for the various "
"elements of a single storyboard first, select them all and create duplicates "
"for as many boards that you want to fit on your page. For Krita's default "
"storyboard export template, we decided that it would be nice to have 5 "

"Once you've renamed your rectangle you can open Inkscape's :guilabel:`Object "

"Now we do the same thing for comments. As the template maker, it's up to you "
"to decide how many comment tracks you want to support and what those tracks "
"should be used for and named. Like I mentioned above, I opted for 2 comment "
"tracks on the default template. One, simply called \"comment\", can be used "
"for whatever you want, but probably for a short description of the action in "
"each shot, and should match the default name of a comment track within "
"Krita. The other one, called \"sound\", is meant to be used as a description "
"of the audio during each cut, including dialogue, sound effects, and "
"background music. Having studied some of the storyboard books that I own "
"from shows that I love, I decided to put \"sound\" on the left side of the "
"image, and \"comment\" on the right."

"using Krita's default storyboard export template file, then you should name "
"your comment tracks \"comment\" (the default name, by the way) and \"sound"

"the duration of the shot, expressed in \"Seconds + Frames\" format. Of "
"course, just like the \"image\" and \"comment\" boxes, these \"shot\" and "
