"Even though you can't see the colors, the computer program does understand "

"For exchanging between programs and devices: most CMYK profiles are a little "
"bigger than our default sRGB in places, while in other places, they are "
"smaller. To get the best conversion, having your image in a space that "
"encompasses both your screen profile as your printer profile."

"For archival purposes. In other words, maybe monitors of the future will "
"have larger amounts of colors they can show (spoiler: they already do), and "
"this allows you to be prepared for that."

"On the left we have an artifact-ridden color managed JPEG file with an ACES "
"sRGBtrc v2 profile attached (or not, if not, then you can see the exact "
"different between the colors more clearly). This should give an "
"approximation of the actual colors. On the right, we have an sRGB PNG that "
"was converted in Krita from the base file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_space_size.rst:43
msgid ""
"Each of the gradients is the gradient from the max of a given channel. As "
"you can see, the mid-tone of the ACES color space is much brighter than the "
"mid-tone of the RGB colorspace, and this is because the primaries are "
"further apart."

msgid ""
"What this means for us is that when we start mixing or applying filters, "
"Krita can output values higher than visible, but also generate more correct "
"mixes and gradients. In particular, when color correcting, the bigger space "
"can help with giving more precise information."

"If you have a display profile that uses a LUT, then you can use perceptual "

"Bigger spaces do have the downside they require more precision if you do not "
"want to see banding, so make sure to have at the least 16bit per channel "
"when choosing a bigger space."
