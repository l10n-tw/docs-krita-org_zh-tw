"For some time Photoshop has been using the ABR format to compile brushes "
"into a single file.  Krita can read and load ``.abr`` files, although there "
"are certain features. For this example we will use an example of an ``.abr`` "
"file that contains numerous images of types of trees and ferns.  We have two "
"objectives.  The first is to create a series of brushes that we an quickly "
"access from the Brush Presets dock to easily put together a believable "
"forest.  The second is to create a single brush that we can  change on the "
"fly to use for a variety of flora, without the need to have a dedicated "
"Brush Preset for each type."

"It's time now to create the Brush Preview graphic. The simplest and easiest "
"way to do this for a brush of this type is to clear out the ScratchPad using "
"the :guilabel:`Reset` button. Now, center your cursor in the Brush Preview "
"square at the top of the ScratchPad and click once. You should see an image "
"of your texture (in this case it would be the evergreen tree). In order to "
"work correctly though the entire image should fit comfortably within the "
"square. This might mean that you have to tweak the size of the brush. Once "
"you have something you are happy with then click the :guilabel:`Overwrite "
"Brush` button and your brush and its preview image will be saved."
