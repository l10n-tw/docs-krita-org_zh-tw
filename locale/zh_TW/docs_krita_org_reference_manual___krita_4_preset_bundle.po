"The Dry Painting category is full set of brushes that appear like bristles. "
"They do not interact with the color already on the canvas; that's why they "

"Simulating real watercolors is highly complex. These brushes only partially "

msgid ""
"Painting with ready-made shapes can help concept artists create happy-"
"accidents and stimulate the imagination. The Shape Fill tool is a bit "
"specific: you can draw a silhouette of shape and Krita fills it in real "
"time. Painting shapes over an area helps fill it with random details. This "

"You might believe this section is specific to pixel-artist, but in many "
"situations dealing with specific pixels are needed to make corrections and "
"adjustments even on normal paintings. A thin 1px brush can be used to trace "
"guidelines. A brush with aliasing is also perfect to fix the color island "
"created by the Coloring-mask feature."

msgid "Experimental"

msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/krita_4_preset_bundle.rst:152
msgid ""
"Useful for 3D programs and texture artists. If your tablet supports tilting "
"and rotation this brush will allow you to paint on your normal map using "
"your brush rotation and orientation. You can \"sculpt\" your details in the "
"texture with the different colors. Each color will map to an angle that is "
"used for 3D lighting. It works well on pen-tablet display (tablet with a "
"screen) as you can better sync the rotation and tilting of your stylus with "
"the part of the normal map you want to paint."

msgid "Filters"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/krita_4_preset_bundle.rst:159

"Krita can apply many of its filters on a brush thanks to the filter brush "

"ability of Krita."

msgid "Stamps"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/krita_4_preset_bundle.rst:173

"The stamps are a bit similar to the texture category. Stamps often paint a "
