"This category is for graphics file-formats. While most file-formats can be "
"looked up on wikipedia, this doesn't always explain what the format can be "
"used for and what its strengths and weaknesses are."

"In this category we try to describe these in a manner that can be read by "

"Generally, there are the following features that people pay attention to in "
"regards to file formats:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Compression"
msgstr "壓縮"

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:25
msgid ""
"Compression is how the file-format tries to describe the image with as "
"little data as possible, so that the resulting file is as small as it can "
"get without losing quality."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:27
msgid ""
"What we generally see is that formats that are small on disk either lose "
"image quality, or require the computer to spend a lot of time thinking about "
"how the image should look."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:29
msgid ""
"Vector file-formats like ``SVG`` are a typical example of the latter. They "
"are really small because the technology used to create them is based on "
"mathematics, so it only stores maths-variables and can achieve very high "
"quality. The downside is that the computer needs to spend a lot of time "
"thinking about how it should look, and sometimes different programs have "
"different ways of interpreting the values. Furthermore, vector file-formats "
"imply vector graphics, which is a very different way of working than Krita "
"is specialized in."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:31
msgid ""
":ref:`Lossy file formats <lossy_compression>`, like ``JPG`` or ``WebP`` are "
"an example of small on disk, but lowering the quality, and are best used for "
"very particular types of images. Lossy thus means that the file format plays "
"fast and loose with describing your image to reduce filesize."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:33
msgid ""
":ref:`Non-lossy or lossless formats <lossless_compression>`, like ``PNG``, "
"``GIF`` or ``BMP`` are in contrast, much heavier on disk, but much more "
"likely to retain quality."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:35
msgid ""
"Then, there's proper working file formats like Krita's ``KRA``, Gimp's "
"``XCF``, Photoshop's ``PSD``, but also interchange formats like ``ORA`` and "
"``EXR``. These are the heaviest on the hard-drive and often require special "
"programs to open them up, but on the other hand these are meant to keep your "
"working environment intact, and keep all the layers and guides in them."

msgid "Metadata"
msgstr "中繼資料"

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:40
msgid ""
"Metadata is the ability of a file format to contain information outside of "
"the actual image contents. This can be human readable data, like the date of "
"creation, the name of the author, a description of the image, but also "
"computer readable data, like an ICC profile which tells the computer about "
"the qualities of how the colors inside the file should be read."
msgstr ""

msgid "Openness"
msgstr "開放性"

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:45
msgid ""
"This is a bit of an odd quality, but it's about how easy it to open or "
"recover the file, and how widely it's supported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:47
msgid ""
"Most internal file formats, like PSD are completely closed, and it's really "
"difficult for human outsiders to recover the data inside without opening "
"Photoshop. Other examples are camera raw files which have different "
"properties per camera manufacturer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:49
msgid ""
"SVG, as a vector file format, is on the other end of the spectrum, and can "
"be opened with any text-editor and edited."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:51
msgid ""
"Most formats are in-between, and thus there's also a matter of how widely "
"supported the format is. JPG and PNG cannot be read or edited by human eyes, "
"but the vast majority of programs can open them, meaning the owner has easy "
"access to them."
