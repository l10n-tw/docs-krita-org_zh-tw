"Even though Krita is regarded primarily a raster based application, it has "

"In digital imaging, a pixel (Picture Element) is a basic and lowest element "
"of an Image. It is basically a grid of points each displaying specific "
"color. Raster editing is manipulating and editing these pixels. For example "
"when you take a 1-pixel brush which is colored black and painting on the "
"white canvas in Krita you are actually changing the color of the pixel "
"beneath your brush from white to black. When you zoom in and see a brush "
"stroke you can notice many small squares with colors, these are pixels:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/getting_started/basic_concepts.rst:39
msgid ""
"In contrast to raster images, vector graphic images are based on "
"mathematical expressions. They are independent of the pixels. For example, "
"when you draw a rectangle on a :ref:`vector layer <vector_layers>` in Krita "
"you are actually drawing paths passing through points that are called nodes, "
"which are located on specific coordinates on the 'x' and 'y' axes. When you "
"re-size or move these points the computer calculates and redraws the path "
"and displays the newly formed shape to you. Hence, you can re-size the "
"vector shape to any extent without any loss in quality. In Krita, everything "
"which is not on a vector layer is raster based."
