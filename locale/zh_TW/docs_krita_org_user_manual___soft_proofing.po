"When we make an image in Krita, and print that out with a printer, the image "
"tends to look different. The colors are darker, or less dark than expected, "
"maybe the reds are more aggressive, maybe contrast is lost. For simple "
"documents, this isn’t much of a problem, but for professional prints, this "
"can be very sad, as it can change the look and feel of an image drastically."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:20
msgid ""
"The reason this happens is simply because the printer uses a different color "
"model (CMYK) and it has often access to a lower range of colors (called a "
"gamut)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:22
msgid ""
"A naive person would suggest the following solution: do your work within the "
"CMYK color model! But there are three problems with that:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:24
msgid ""
"Painting in a CMYK space doesn’t guarantee that the colors will be the same "
"on your printer. For each combination of Ink, Paper and Printing device, the "
"resulting gamut of colors you can use is different, which means that each of "
"these could have a different profile associated with them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:25
msgid ""
"Furthermore, even if you have the profile and are working in the exact color "
"space that your printer can output, the CMYK color space is very irregular, "
"meaning that the color maths isn’t as nice as in other spaces. Blending "
"modes are different in CMYK as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:26
msgid ""
"Finally, working in that specific CMYK space means that the image is stuck "
"to that space. If you are preparing your work for different a CMYK profile, "
"due to the paper, printer or ink being different, you might have a bigger "
"gamut with more bright colors that you would like to take advantage of."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:28
msgid ""
"So ideally, you would do the image in RGB, and use all your favorite RGB "
"tools, and let the computer do a conversion to a given CMYK space on the "
"fly, just for preview. This is possible, and is what we call ''Soft "
"Proofing''."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:34
msgid ""
"On the left, the original, on the right, a view where soft proofing is "
"turned on. The difference is subtle due to the lack of really bright colors, "
"but the soft proofed version is slightly less blueish in the whites of the "
"flowers and slightly less saturated in the greens of the leaves."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:36
msgid ""
"You can toggle soft proofing on any image using the :kbd:`Ctrl + Y` "
"shortcut. Unlike other programs, this is per-view, so that you can look at "
"your image non-proofed and proofed, side by side. The settings are also per "
"image, and saved into the ``.kra`` file. You can set the proofing options "
"in :menuselection:`Image --> Image Properties --> Soft Proofing`."

"Of these, only the profile is really important. This will serve as the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:51
msgid ""
"A feature which allows you to set whether :guilabel:`Absolute Colorimetric` "
"will make the white in the image screen-white during proofing (the slider "
"set to max), or whether it will use the white point of the profile (the "
"slider set to minimum). Often CMYK profiles have a different white as the "
"screen, or amongst one another due to the paper color being different."

"Set the black point compensation. Turning this off will crunch the shadow "

"To configure this properly, it's recommended to make a test image to print "
