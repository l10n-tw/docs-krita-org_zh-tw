"However, you can make a brush a little easier by using the Gradient, Mix and "
"HSV options in the :ref:`pixel and color smudge brushes "
"<pixel_brush_engine>`. Basically, what we want to do is have a stroke start "
"dark and then become lighter as we draw with it, to simulate how hair-tips "
"catch more light and look lighter due to being thinner at the ends, while at "
"the base they are frequently more dark."

"should be able to get similar results with brush preset :guilabel:`b) "
"Basic-5 Size` and brush tip :guilabel:`sparkle` or other similar brush "

"the :guilabel:`Enable Pen Settings` on flow. Replicate the pressure curve "
"above on the size option. We don’t want the hairs to collapse to a point, "

"Then activate value and reproduce this curve with the :guilabel:`Distance` "
"or :guilabel:`Fade` sensor. Like how the pressure sensor changes a value "
"(like size) with the amount of pressure you put on the stylus, the distance "
"sensor measures how many pixels your stroke is, and can change an option "
"depending on that. For the HSV sensors: If the curve goes beneath the "
"middle, it’ll become remove from that adjustment, and above the vertical "
"middle it’ll add to that adjustment. So in this case, for the first 100px "
"the brush dab will go from a darkened version of the active paint color, to "
"the active paint color, and then for 100px+ it’ll go from the active color "
"to a lightened version. The curve is an inverse S-curve, because we want to "
"give a lot of room to the mid-tones."

"We do the same thing for saturation, so that the darkened color is also "
