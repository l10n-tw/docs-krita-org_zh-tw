"Usually, most digital styles tend to focus on simple brushes, like the round "
"brushes, and their usage in hair is no different. So, the typical example "
"would be the one on the left, where we use *fill_round* to draw a silhouette "
"and build up to lighter values."

"The reason I use *fill_round* here is because the pressure curve on the size "
"is s-shaped. My tablet has a spring-loaded nib which also causes and s-"
"shaped curve hard-ware wise. This means that it becomes really easy to draw "
"thin lines and big lines. Having a trained inking hand helps a lot with this "
"as well, and it’s something you build up over time."

"We then gloss the shadow parties with the *basic_tip_default*. So you can "

"almost convinced tysontan, who draws our mascot, doesn’t use anything but "
"the *basic_tip_default* sometimes."

"However, if you want an easy hair brush, just take the *fill_round*, go to "
"the brush-tip, pick predefined and select *A2-sparkle-1* as the brush tip. "
"You can fiddle with the spacing below the selection of predefined brushtip "
"to space the brush, but I believe the default should be fine enough to get "
"result."
