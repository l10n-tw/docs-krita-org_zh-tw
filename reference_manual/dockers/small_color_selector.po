"The small color selector is the only selector which can show HDR values. "
"When your build of Krita is HDR enabled and you are on Windows, you can drag "
"the slider at the bottom to increase the 'nits' of the colors in the small "
"selector. This is the direct value of the brightness of the colors, and you "
"need a value above 100 (100 being the maximum value used for the brightest "
"value of sRGB colors), to have an HDR color. The small color selector will "
"also select wide gamut values."
