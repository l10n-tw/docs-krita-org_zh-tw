":dfn:`Utilities` -- The left side of the toolbar gives animators quick "
"access to all of the widgets that are critical to their workflow; :dfn:"

":dfn:`Layer List` -- This area contains some subset of the layers of your "

"properties that can also be toggled here (visibility, locking, onion skins, "
"etc.).  While the currently active layer is always shown here, layers can "
"also be \"pinned\" to the timeline using the pin button to the left of each "

":dfn:`Frame Table` -- The :dfn:`frame table` is a large grid of cells which "

"the active keyframe will be the frame on the active layer that is on or just "

"Now that we have more than one keyframe, we can do different drawings in "

"also known as \"scrubbing\". Like everything else, we've made sure that "

"There are a couple subtle features built into the docker's transport "
"controls that you might find useful. For example, clicking the :guilabel:"
"`stop button` *while your animation is playing* will jump back to whatever "
"frame you started playing from, and clicking it again *when your animation "
"is not playing* will jump back to the first frame of your animation. "
"Similarly, the :guilabel:`next keyframe` button will jump the selection to "
"the next available keyframe on the active layer, but *if there is no next "
"keyframe on that layer it will use the timing of your animation to estimate "
"where you may want to place your next keyframe, and jump to that position.* "
"While a bit advanced, nuances like this mean that the Animation Timeline "
"Docker's buttons (and keybind-able actions) almost always do something "
"useful for animators."

"You can also change the color of keyframes within the frame table so that "
