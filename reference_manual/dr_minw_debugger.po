"If you have your Krita version installed and you want to get a backtrace, "
"it's best to download a portable version (either the latest release, or the "
"one that someone told you to try, for example Krita Next or Krita Plus "
"package). Alongside downloading the portable version, download the debug "
"symbols package, too. It should be located in the same place you download "
"Krita. You can see which is which by checking the end of the name of the ZIP "
"file - debug symbols package always ends with *-dbg.zip*."
