"Instant Preview (previously known under the code name Level Of Detail/LOD "
"strokes) is Krita's special speed-up mechanism that was funded by the 2015 "
"Kickstarter. Krita slows down with really large images due to the large "
"amount of data it's crunching in painting these images. Instant Preview "
"works by taking a smaller version of the canvas, and drawing the feedback on "
"there while Krita calculates the real stroke in the background. This means "
"that if you have a 4k screen and are working on a 4k image at 100% zoom, you "
"won't feel any speed up."

"Instant Preview requires OpenGL 3.0 support at minimum. So if you don't "
"have :guilabel:`high-quality` scaling available in :menuselection:`Settings "
"--> Configure Krita... --> Display --> Display scaling filter`, then you "
"won't be able to use Instant Preview either."

"Instant Preview is activated in two places: The view menu (:kbd:`Shift + L` "

"Similarly, the auto-spacing, fuzzy sensor in size, use of density in brush-"
"tip and the use of texture paintops will make it more difficult to determine "
"a stroke, and thus will give a feeling of 'popping' when the stroke is "
"finished."
