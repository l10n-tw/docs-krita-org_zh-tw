"Use this tool to paint an ellipse. The currently selected brush is used for "
"drawing the ellipse outline. Click and hold the left mouse button to "
"indicate one corner of the ‘bounding rectangle’ of the ellipse, then move "
"your mouse to the opposite corner. :program:`Krita` will show a preview of "

"You can change between the corner/corner and center/corner dragging methods "
"as often as you want by holding down or releasing the :kbd:`Ctrl` key, "
"provided you keep the left mouse button pressed. With the :kbd:`Ctrl` key "
"pressed, mouse movements will affect all four corners of the bounding "
"rectangle (relative to the center), without the :kbd:`Ctrl` key, the corner "
"opposite to the one you are moving remains still. With the :kbd:`Alt` key "
"pressed, all four corners will be affected, but the size stays the same."
