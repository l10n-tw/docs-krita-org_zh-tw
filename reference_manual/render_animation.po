"For rendering to an animated file format, Krita will first render to a PNG "
"sequence and then use FFmpeg, which is really good at encoding into video "
"files, to render that sequence to an animated file format. The reason for "
"this two-step process is that animation files can be really complex and "
"really big, and this is the best way to allow you to keep control over the "
"export process. For example, if your computer has a hiccup, and one frame "
"saves out weird, first saving the image sequence allows you to only resave "
"that one weird frame before rendering."
