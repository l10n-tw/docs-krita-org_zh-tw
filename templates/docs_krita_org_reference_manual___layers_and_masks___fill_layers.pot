Newly created colored fill layers will be assigned to the currently active foreground color, unless they were made by drag-and-dropping a :ref:`palette swatch <palette_docker>` onto the :ref:`layer stack <layer_docker>`."

msgid "A fill-layer is a single-channel layer, meaning it only has transparency. Therefore, you can erase and paint on fill-layers to make them semi-opaque, or for when you want to have a particular color only. Being single channel, fill-layers are also a little bit less memory-consuming than regular 4-channel paint layers."
