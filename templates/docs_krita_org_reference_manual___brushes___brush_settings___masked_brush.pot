msgid "Masked brush is new feature that is only available in the :ref:`pixel_brush_engine`. They are additional settings you will see in the brush editor. Masked brushes allow you to combine two brush tips in one stroke. One brush tip will be a mask for your primary brush tip. A masked brush is a good alternative to texture for creating expressive and textured brushes."
