msgid "There are various sections in this dialog box which aid in creation of new document, either using custom document properties or by using contents from clipboard and templates. Following are the sections in this dialog box:"

msgid "Custom Document"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/create_new_document.rst:39
msgid "From this section you can create a document according to your requirements: you can specify the dimensions, color model, bit depth, resolution, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/create_new_document.rst:42
msgid "In the top-most field of the :guilabel:`Dimensions` tab, from the Predefined drop-down you can select predefined pixel sizes and PPI (pixels per inch). You can also set custom dimensions and the orientation of the document from the input fields below the :guilabel:`Predefined:` drop-down. This can also be saved as a new predefined preset for your future use by giving a name in the :guilabel:`Save Image Size as:` input box and clicking on the :guilabel:`Save` button. Below we find the Color section of the new document dialog box, where you can select the color model and the bit-depth. Check :ref:`general_concept_color` for more detailed information regarding color."

msgid "On the :guilabel:`Content` tab, you can define a name for your new document. This name will appear in the metadata of the file, and Krita will use it for the auto-save functionality as well. If you leave it empty, the document will be referred to as 'Unnamed' by default. You can select the background color and the amount of layers you want in the new document. Krita remembers the amount of layers you picked last time, so be careful."

msgid "Templates:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/create_new_document.rst:74
msgid "These are separate categories where we deliver special defaults. Templates are just ``.kra`` files which are saved in a special location, so they can be pulled up by Krita quickly. You can make your own template file from any ``.kra`` file, by using :menuselection:`File --> Create Template from Image...` in the top menu. This will add your current document as a new template, including all its properties along with the layers and layer contents."
