msgid "While you can open up SVG files with any text-editor to edit them, it is best to use a vector program like Inkscape. Krita 2.9 to 3.3 supports importing SVG via the add shape docker. Since Krita 4.0, SVGs can be properly imported, and you can export singlevector layers via :menuselection:`Layer --> Import/Export --> Save Vector Layer as SVG...` menu item. For 4.0, Krita will also use SVG to save vector data into its :ref:`internal format <file_kra>`."

msgid "SVG is designed for the internet, though sadly, because vector graphics are considered a bit obscure compared to raster graphics, not a lot of websites accept them yet. Hosting them on your own webhost works just fine though."
