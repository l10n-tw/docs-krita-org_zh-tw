msgid "Magnetify is *on* by default. It's what causes curve lines to form between two close line sections, as though the curve lines are attracted to them like magnets. With Magnetify *off*, the curve line just forms on either side of the current active portion of your connection line. In other words, your line becomes fuzzier when another portion of the line is nearby, but the lines don't connect to said previous portion."

For this reason, the only time this option will make a visible difference is if you're drawing with 0% or near 0% density, and with a thick line width. The rest of the time, this option won't make a visible difference."
