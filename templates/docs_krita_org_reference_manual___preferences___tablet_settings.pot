msgid "Some tablet devices don't tell us whether the side buttons on a stylus. If you have such a device, you can try activate this workaround. Krita will try to read right and middle-button clicks as if they were coming from a mouse instead of a tablet. It may or may not work on your device (depends on the tablet driver implementation). After changing this option Krita should be restarted."

#: ../../reference_manual/preferences/tablet_settings.rst:39
msgid "With some devices the speed samples can be very erratic. This can be reduced by instead of using each sample on its own, several samples are compared to find a smoother value. This controls how many speed samples should be taken into account. Note that too many samples can result in the loss of subtle speed changes."

This is a relatively new addition so it's still considered to be experimental, but it should work well enough for painting. You should try this if you are using an N-Trig device (e.g. recent Microsoft Surface devices) or if your tablet does not work well with WinTab."
