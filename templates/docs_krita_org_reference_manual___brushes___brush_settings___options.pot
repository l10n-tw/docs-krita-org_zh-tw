msgid "Drawing Angle -- A common one, usually used in combination with rake-type brushes. Especially effect because it does not rely on tablet-specific sensors. Sometimes, Tilt-Direction or Rotation is used to achieve a similar-more tablet focused effect, where with Tilt the 0° is at 12 o'clock, Drawing angle uses 3 o'clock as 0°."

That way you'll have to press hard for thick lines."
