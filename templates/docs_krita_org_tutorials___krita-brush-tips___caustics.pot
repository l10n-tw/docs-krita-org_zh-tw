msgid "Sure, caustics, it’s not like it’s the most complicated effect known to CG graphics… Okay, so the first thing is that light effects never work in isolation: you need to be spot on with colors and other effects to make it work. So we first need to recreate the surroundings a bit."

msgid "Note how the smudge brush here is used not just to mix areas, but also to create definition of borders by lowering the scatter. (If you reverse the pressure curve on the scatter, this’ll be easily done by increasing the pressure on the stylus)"

#: ../../tutorials/krita-brush-tips/caustics.rst:64
msgid "Then you start slowly building up your lines. (Make sure to make a copy of the layer. The color dodge blending doesn’t work well on a separate layer, so do it on one that also has the ground on it.)"
