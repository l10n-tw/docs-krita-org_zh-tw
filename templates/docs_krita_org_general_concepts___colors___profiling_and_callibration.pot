msgid "Choosing the right workspace profile to use depends on how much colors you need and on the bit depth you plan to use. Imagine a line with the whole color spectrum from pure black (0,0,0) to pure blue (0,0,1) in a pure XYZ color cube. If you divide it choosing steps at a regular interval, you get what is called a linear profile, with a gamma=1 curve represented as a straight line from 0 to 1. With 8bit/channel bit depth, we have only 256 values to store this whole line. If we use a linear profile as described above to define those color values, we will miss some important visible color change steps and have a big number of values looking the same (leading to posterization effect)."

msgid "This is why was created the sRGB profile to fit more different colors in this limited amount of values, in a perceptually regular grading, by applying a custom gamma curve (see picture here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) to emulate the standard response curve of old CRT screens. So sRGB profile is optimized to fit all colors that most common screen can reproduce in those 256 values per R/G/B channels. Some other profiles like Adobe RGB are optimized to fit more printable colors in this limited range, primarily extending cyan-green hues. Working with such profile can be useful to improve print results, but is dangerous if not used with a properly profiled and/or calibrated good display. Most common CMYK workspace profile can usually fit all their colors within 8bit/channel depth, but they are all so different and specific that it's usually better to work with a regular RGB workspace first and then convert the output to the appropriate CMYK profile."

msgid "Starting with 16bit/channel, we already have 65536 values instead of 256, so we can use workspace profiles with higher gamut range like Wide-gamut RGB or Pro-photo RGB, or even unlimited gamut like scRGB."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/profiling_and_callibration.rst:40
msgid "But sRGB being a generic profile (even more as it comes from old CRT specifications...), there are big chances that your monitor have actually a different color response curve, and so color profile. So when you are using sRGB workspace and have a proper screen profile loaded (see next point), Krita knows that the colors the file contains are within the sRGB color space, and converts those sRGB values to corresponding color values from your monitor profile to display the canvas."

msgid "The most important one is the one of your own screen. It doesn't come bundled, and you have to make it with a color profiling device. In case you don't have access to such a device, you can't make use of Krita's color management as intended. However, Krita does allow the luxury of picking any of the other bundled profiles as working spaces."

msgid "Just profiling your screen means measuring the colors of your monitor with its native settings and put those values in a color profile, which can be used by color-managed application to adapt source colors to the screen for optimal result. Calibrating and profiling means the same except that first you try to calibrate the screen colors to match a certain standard setting like sRGB or other more specific profiles. Calibrating is done first with hardware controls (lightness, contrast, gamma curves), and then with software that creates a vcgt (video card gamma table) to load in the GPU."
