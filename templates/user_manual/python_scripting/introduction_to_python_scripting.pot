msgid "Python is a scripting language, that can be used to automate tasks. What python scripting in Krita means is that we added an API to krita, which is a bit of programming that allows python to access to parts of Krita. With this we can make dockers, perform menial tasks on a lot of different files and even write our own exporters. People who work with computer graphics, like VFX and video game artists use python a lot to make things like sprite sheets, automate parts of export and more."

The magic happens because of a Python tool called SIP, which makes it possible for python speak in C++ and talk to Krita. The end result is that when we ``import krita`` and call functions, we're actually using the C++ methods listed in that documentation."

For example, you can see that the function filters() returns a QStringList. However, SIP converts those QStringLists into regular python list of strings!"
