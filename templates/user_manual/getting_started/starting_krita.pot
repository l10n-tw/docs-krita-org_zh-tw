msgid "When you start Krita for the first time there will be no canvas or new document open by default. You will be greeted by a :ref:`welcome screen <welcome_screen>`, which will have option to create a new file or open existing document. To create a new canvas you have to create a new document from the :guilabel:`File` menu or by clicking on :guilabel:`New File`  under start section of the welcome screen. This will open the new file dialog box. If you want to open an existing image, either use :menuselection:`File --> Open...` or drag the image from your computer into Krita's window."

This erasing method works with most of the tools. You can erase using the line tool, rectangle tool, and even the gradient tool."

The save option is in the same place as it is in all other computer programs: the top-menu of :guilabel:`File`, and then :guilabel:`Save`. Select the folder you want to have your drawing, and select the file format you want to use (``.kra`` is Krita's default format, and will save everything). And then hit :guilabel:`Save`. Some older versions of Krita have a bug and require you to manually type the extension."
