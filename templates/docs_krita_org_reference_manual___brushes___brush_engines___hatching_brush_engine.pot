msgid "The hatching itself is mostly fixed in location, so drawing with a hatching brush usually acts more like \"revealing\" the hatching underneath than drawing with brushes of parallel lines. The exception is for :guilabel:`Moiré pattern` with :guilabel:`Crosshatching` dynamics on."

msgid ":guilabel:`Antialiased lines`: This controls aliasing. If changing line thickness isn't working, check this option and it should work, because it switches to a different algorithm."

msgid "You can, of course, just use this for completely normal hatching. In versions I'm using, the default Separation is 1, which is too low, so increase Separation to a value between 2 to 10."

msgid "If you find normal hatching too boring, increase the Thickness and set the Thickness dynamic to either Pressure (if you have a tablet) or Speed (if you're using a mouse).
