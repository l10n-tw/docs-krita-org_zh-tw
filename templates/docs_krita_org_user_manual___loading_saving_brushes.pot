msgid "In a digital program like Krita you have something similar. We call this a brush engine.

msgid "Krita's brush settings are stored into the metadata of a 200x200 PNG (the KPP file), where the image in the PNG file becomes the preset icon. This icon is used everywhere in Krita, and is useful for differentiating brushes in ways that the live preview cannot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/loading_saving_brushes.rst:67
msgid "The live preview shows a stroke of the current brush as a little s-curve wiggle, with the pressure being non-existent on the left, and increasing to full pressure as it goes to the right. It can thus show the effect of the Pressure, Drawing Angle, Distance, Fade and Fuzzy Dab sensors, but none of the others. For some brush engines it cannot show anything. For the color smudge, filter brush and clone tool, it shows an alternating line pattern because these brush engines use the pixels already on canvas to change their effect."

msgid "The engine of a brush is the underlying programming that generates the stroke from a brush. What that means is that different brush engines have different options and different results. You can see this as the difference between using crayons, pencils and inks, but because computers are math devices, most of our brush engines produce different things in a more mathematical way."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/loading_saving_brushes.rst:88
msgid "For most artists the mathematical nature doesn't matter as much as the different textures and marks each brush engine, and each brush engine has its own distinct flavor and use, and can be further customized by modifying the options."

msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/loading_saving_brushes.rst:237
msgid "One of the big important things that make art unique to the artist who created it is the style of the strokes. Strokes are different because they differ in speed, rotation, direction, and the amount of pressure put onto the stylus. Because these are so important, we would want to customize how these values are understood in detail. The best way to do this is to use curves."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/loading_saving_brushes.rst:244
msgid "Curves show up with the size widget for example. With an inking brush, we want to have size mapped to pressure. Just toggling the size option in the option list will do that."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/loading_saving_brushes.rst:248
msgid "However, different people have different wrists and thus will press differently on their stylus. Someone who presses softly tends to find it easy to make thin strokes, but very difficult to make thick strokes. Conversely, someone who presses hard on their stylus naturally will have a hard time making thin strokes, but easily makes thick ones."
msgstr ""
