#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:22
msgid "These are the two important characteristics. The colorspace has a few more properties than this, such as the white point, or more importantly, the colorants that make up the gamut. But here’s the thing, those two could be anything, as long as the space is linear and the color depth is floating point."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:24
msgid "So, *Scene Linear is not a single one colorspace, but a* **TYPE** *of colorspace*. You can have a scene linear space that uses the sRGB/Rec. 709 colorants, or one that uses adobeRGB, or maybe one that uses Rec. 2020, as long as it is *linear* and in a *floating point bit depth*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:28
msgid "If you want to create images for display on an HDR canvas, you will need to select the Rec. 2020 space profile with a linear gamma. The default profile in Krita for that is :guilabel:`Rec2020-elle-V4-g10.icc`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:30
msgid "These two factors are for one reason: To make black and white arbitrary values. This might seem a bit weird. But when you are dealing with light-sources, you are dealing with a massive range of contrasts, and will have to decide afterwards which white and black you’d like to have. This is what the scene means in scene-linear, the relevant values are unique per scene, like a real world scene: a flower field lit by moonlight, a city in twilight or a sunny beach. You want to be able to put the right emphasis on the most important contrasting values, and being able to choose what is white and what is black is a very powerful tool here. After all, humans in the real world can see much more when they get used to the dark, or to the sun, so why not apply that to how we make our images?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:32
msgid "This is also why it needs to be Linear. Gamma and Tone-mapped color spaces are already choosing which contrast is the most important to you. But for that, they too need to choose what is white or black. Linear doesn’t make such assumptions, so much better for when you want to choose yourself. You will eventually want to stick your image through some tone-mapping or gamma correction, but only at the end after you have applied filters and mixed colors!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:34
msgid "In fact, there’s always a non-destructive sort of transform going on while you are working on your image which includes the tone-mapping. This is called a display or view transform, and they provide a sort of set of binoculars into the world of your image. Without it, your computer cannot show these colors properly; it doesn’t know how to interpret it properly, often making the image too dark. Providing such a transform and allowing you to configure it is the prime function of color management."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:36
msgid "Between different view and display transforms, there’s also a difference in types. Some are really naive, others are more sophisticated, and some need to be used in a certain manner to work properly. The ICC color management can only give a certain type of view transforms, while OCIO color management in the LUT docker can give much more complex transforms easily configurable and custom settings that can be shared between programs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:42
msgid "Above, an example of the more naive transform provided by going from scene-linear sRGB to regular sRGB, and to the right a more sophisticated transform coming from the filmic blender OCIO configuration. Look at the difference between the paws. Image by Wolthera van Hövell tot Westerflier, License: CC-BY-SA"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:44
msgid "Conversely, transforming and interpreting your image’s colors is the only thing OCIO can do, and it can do it with really complex transforms, really fast. It doesn’t understand what your image’s color space is originally, doesn’t understand what CMYK is, and there’s also no such thing as a OCIO color profile. Therefore you will need to switch to an ICC workflow if you wish to prepare for print."

msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:54
msgid "Simple Blending Modes like Multiply or Addition are suddenly black magic. This is because Scene-Linear is the closest you can get to the physical (as in, physics, not material) model of color where multiplying colors with one another is one of the main ways to calculate the effect of light."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:55
msgid "Combining painting with other image results such as photography and physically based rendering is much easier as they too work in such a type of colorspace. So you could use such images as a reference with little qualms, or make textures that play nice with such a renderer."
msgstr ""

msgid "In particular, there are many tools in a digital painter’s toolbox that have **hard-coded assumptions about black and white**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:66
msgid "A very simple but massive problem is one with **inversion**. Inverting colors is done code-wise by taking the color for white and subtracting the color you want to invert from it. It’s used in many blending modes. But often the color white is hardcoded in these filters. There’s currently no application out there that allows you to define the value range that inversion is done with, so inverting is useless. And that also means the filters and blending modes that use it, such as (but not limited to)..."

msgid "Another one is HSL, HSI and HSY algorithms. They too need to assume something about the top value to allow scaling to white. HSV doesn’t have this problem. So it’s best to use an HSV color selector."
msgstr ""

msgid "For the blending modes that use HSY, there’s always the issue that they tend to be hardcoded to sRGB/Rec. 709 values, but are otherwise fine (and they give actually far more correct results in a linear space). So these are not a good idea to use with wide-gamut colorspaces, and due to the assumption about black and white, not with scene linear painting. The following blending modes use them:"

msgid "In a Scene Linear Color space, this is flipped. White is now more overpowering and black gets washed out super quickly. This relates to the additive nature of digital color theory, that becomes more obvious when working in linear."

msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:108
msgid "16 bit float per channel images are big. 32 bit float per channel images are bigger. This means that they will eat RAM and that painting and filtering will be slower. This is something that will fix itself over the years, but not many people have such a high-end PC yet, so it can be a blocker."

msgid "In Summary"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:115
msgid "Scene Linear Painting is painting an image in a color space that is linear and has a floating point bit depth. This does not assume anything about the values of black and white, so you can only use tools that don’t assume anything about the values of black and white. It has the advantage of having nicer filter results and better color mixtures as well as better interoperability with other scene-linear output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:117
msgid "To be able to view such an image you use a view transform, also called a display conversion. Which means that if you wish to finalize your image for the web, you make a copy of the image that goes through a display conversion or view transform that then gets saved to PNG, JPEG or TIFF."

HDR images are standardised to use the Rec. 2020 gamut, which is much larger than sRGB in size, so this ensures you've got access to all the colors."

msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:150
msgid "Where with the value based workflow you paint the image as if it were a grayscale of what you intended to paint, with a lighting based workflow you paint as if all the objects are white. The effect of the color of an object can be determined by multiplying its base color with the color of the light. So you could paint objects as if they were white, paint the colors on a separate layer and just use the Multiply blending mode to get the right colors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:156
msgid "The leftmost image is both the lighting based one and the color layer separate, the middle with the two layers multiplied and the right a luminosity based view. This cat is a nice example as it demonstrates why having textures and lighting separate could be interesting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:158
msgid "You can even combine this with a value based workflow by opening a new view and setting the component to luminosity. That way you can see both the grayscale as well as the lighting based version of the image next to one another."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/scene_linear_painting.rst:160
msgid "The keen minded will notice that a lighting based workflow kind of resembles the idea of a light pass and a color pass in 3d rendering. And indeed, it is basically the same, so you can use lighting passes from 3d renders here, just save them as EXR and import them as a layer. One of the examples where scene linear painting simplifies combining methods."

This is called LUT baking and not possible yet in Krita. Therefore you will have to save out your image in EXR and open it in either Blender or Natron.
