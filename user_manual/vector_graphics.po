"Krita is primarily a raster graphics editing tool, which means that most of "
"the editing changes the values of the pixels on the raster that makes up the "
"image."

"Vector graphics on the other hand use mathematics to describe a shape. "
"Because it uses a formula, vector graphics can be resized to any size."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/vector_graphics.rst:29
msgid ""
"On one hand, this makes vector graphics great for logos and banners. On the "
"other hand, raster graphics are much easier to edit, so vectors tend to be "
"the domain of deliberate design, using a lot of precision."

#: ../../user_manual/vector_graphics.rst:34
msgid ""
"You can start making vector graphics by first making a vector layer (press "
"the arrow button next to the :guilabel:`+` in the layer docker to get extra "
"layer types). Then, all the usual drawing tools outside of the freehand, "
"dynamic and the multibrush tool can be used to draw shapes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/vector_graphics.rst:36
msgid ""
"The path and polyline tool are the tools you used most often on a vector "
"layer, as they allow you to make the most dynamic of shapes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/vector_graphics.rst:38
msgid ""
"On the other hand, the :guilabel:`Ellipse` and :guilabel:`Rectangle` tools "
"allow you to draw special shapes, which then can be edited to make special "
"pie shapes, or for easy rounded rectangles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/vector_graphics.rst:40
msgid ""
"The calligraphy and text tool also make special vectors. The calligraphy "
"tool is for producing strokes that are similar to brush strokes, while the "
"text tool makes a text object that can be edited afterwards."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/vector_graphics.rst:42
msgid ""
"All of these will use the current brush size to determine stroke thickness, "
"as well as the current foreground and background color."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/vector_graphics.rst:44
msgid ""
"There is one last way to make vectors: the :guilabel:`Vector Image` tool.  "
"It allows you to add shapes that have been defined in an SVG file as "
"symbols. Unlike the other tools, these have their own fill and stroke."

msgid ""
"A vector layer has its own hierarchy of shapes, much like how the whole "
"image has a hierarchy of layers. So shapes can be in front of one another. "
"This can be modified with the arrange docker, or with the :guilabel:`Select "
"Shapes` tool."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/vector_graphics.rst:51
msgid ""
"The arrange docker also allows you to group and ungroup shapes. It also "
"allows you to precisely align shapes, for example, have them aligned to the "
"center, or have an even spacing between all the shapes."

msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Select Shapes` tool can be used to select vector shapes, to "
"group them (via |mouseright|), ungroup them, to use booleans to combine or "
"subtract shapes from one another (via |mouseright|), to move them up and "
"down, or to do quick transforms."

"One of the big things Krita 4.0 brought was moving from ODG to SVG. What "
