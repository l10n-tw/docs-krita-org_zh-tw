"The GIMP image hose format allows multiple dimensions for a given brush. You "
"could for example have a dimension that updates incrementally, and one that "
"updates on pressure, or updates randomly. Upon export, Krita will use the "
"ranks to subdivide the layers per dimension. If you have a 24 layer image "
"and three ranks, and the first dimension is set to 2, the second to 4 and "
"the third to 3, then Krita will divide 24 into 2 groups of 12, each of which "
"have unique images for the 2 parts of the first dimension. Then those 2 "
"groups of 12 get divided into 8 groups of 4, each of which have unique brush "
"tips for the four parts of the second dimension, and finally, the grouped "
"three images have each a unique brush for the final dimension."

"So, the following image has a table where dimension 1 is unique in one of 4 "
"numbers, while dimension 2 is unique in one of 3 shapes. So our ranks for "
"dimension 1 and dimension 2 need to be 4 and 3 respectively. Now, to order "
"the layers, you need to subdivide the table first by the first dimension, "
"and then by the second. So we end up with three layers each for a shape in "
"the second dimension but for the first number, then another three layers, "
"each for a shape, but then for the second number, and so forth."
