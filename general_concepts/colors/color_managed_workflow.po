"Device spaces are those describing your monitor, and have to be made using a "
"little device that is called \"colorimeter\". This device, in combination "
"with the right software, measures the strongest red, green and blue your "
"screen can produce, as well as the white, black and gray it produces. Using "
"these and several other measurements it creates an ICC profile unique to "
"your screen. You set these in Krita's color management tab. By default we "
"assume sRGB for screens, but it's very likely that your screen isn't exactly "
"fitting sRGB, especially if you have a high quality screen, where it may be "
"a bigger space instead. Device spaces are also why you should first consult "
"with your printer what profile they expect. Many printing houses have their "

"Knowing this about these spaces of course doesn't give you an idea of how to "

msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:110
msgid ""
"A typical example of a color managed workflow. We have input from scanners "

"different editing software, and is converted to an output space for viewing "
"on screen or printing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:112
msgid ""
"In a traditional color managed workflow, we usually think in terms of real "
"world colors being converted to computer colors and the other way around. "
"So, for example photos from a camera or scanned in images. If you have a "
"device space of such a device, we first assign said device space to the "
"image, and then convert it to a working space."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:114
msgid ""
"We then do all our editing in the working space, and use the working space "
"to communicate between editing programs. In Krita's case, due to it having "
"two color management systems, we use ICC profiles between programs like Gimp "
"2.9+, Inkscape, digiKam and Scribus, and OCIO configuration between Blender "
"and Natron."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:116
msgid ""
"You also store your working files in the working space, just like how you "
"have the layers unmerged in the working file, or have it at a very high "
"resolution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:118
msgid ""
"Sometimes, we apply aesthetic or 'look' spaces to an image as part of the "
"editing process. This is rather advanced, and probably not something to "
"worry about in Krita's case."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:120
msgid ""
"Then, when we're done editing, we try to convert to an output space, which "
"is another device space. This can be CMYK for printers or a special screen "
"RGB profile. When you are dealing with professional printing houses, it is "
"best to ask them about this step. They have a lot of experience with doing "
"the best conversion, and may prefer to do the conversion from your working "
"space to the device space of their printers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:122
msgid ""
"Another form of output is the way your screen displays the color. Unlike "
"regular output, this one is done all the time during editing: After all, you "
"need to be able to see what you are doing, but your screen is still a device "
"with a device space, so it does distort how the image looks. In this manner, "
"you can see your screen as a set of binoculars you have to look through to "
"see your image at all."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:124
msgid ""
"Therefore, without a profiled monitor, you actually don't know what the "
"actual colors you are working with are like, because the computer doesn't "
"know the relevant properties of your screen. So if you profiled your "
"monitor, give Krita the profile in the settings, and select the sRGB space "
"to draw in, you are for the first time seeing the actual colors of the sRGB "
"space."

msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:133
msgid ""
"When we paint from scratch, we can see our screen profile as the input "
"space, because we use it to determine what colors to pick. This somewhat "
"simplifies the workflow, but makes the screen profile and viewing conditions "
"more important."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:135
msgid ""
"Now, photographers and people who do a tricky discipline of VFX called "
"'color grading' will go completely mad over trying to get the colors they "
"put in to come out 100% correctly, and will even count in factors like the "
"time of day and the color they painted their walls. For example, if the wall "
"behind your computer is pure red, your eyes will adjust to be less sensitive "
"to red, which means that the colors they pick in the program could come out "
"redder. We call these the *viewing conditions*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:137
msgid ""
"Thankfully, artists have to worry a slight bit less about this. As "
"illustrations are fully handmade, we are able to identify the important bits "
"and make appropriate contrasts between colors. This means that even if our "
"images turn out to be slightly redder than intended, it is less likely the "
"whole image is ruined. If we look back at the kindergarten example above, we "
"still understand what the image was supposed to look like, despite there "
"being different colors on each image. Furthermore, because the colors in "
"illustrations are deliberately picked, we can correct them more easily on a "
"later date. Yet, at the same time, it is of course a big drag to do this, "
"and we might have had much more flexibility had we taken viewing conditions "
"under consideration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:139
msgid ""
"That said, for artists it is also very useful to understand the working "
"spaces. Different working spaces give different results with filters and "
"mixing, and only some working spaces can be used for advanced technology "
"like HDR."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:141
msgid ""
"Similarly, Krita, as a program intended to make images from scratch, doesn't "
"really worry about assigning workspaces after having made the image. But "
"because you are using the screen as a binocular to look at your image, and "
"to pick colors, you can see your screen's device space as an input space to "
"the image. Hence why profiling your monitor and giving the profile to Krita "
"in the settings can help with preparing your work for print and future "
"ventures in the long run."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:143
msgid ""
"Overall, it is kinda useful to keep things like viewing conditions in the "
"back of your mind. Many professional artists use a mid-gray color as their "
"default canvas background because they find they create much more dynamic "
"images due to having improved their viewing conditions. It is also why a lot "
"of graphics programs, including Krita, come with a dark theme nowadays. "

msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:168

"cLUT profiles work by holding tables of each color in a color space and "
