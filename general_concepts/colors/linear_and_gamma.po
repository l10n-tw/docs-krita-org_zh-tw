"Now, the situation we talk about when talking theory is what we would call "
"'linear'. Each step of brightness is the same value. Our eyes do not "
"perceive linearly. Rather, we find it more easy to distinguish between "
"darker grays than we do between lighter grays."

"As humans are the ones using computers, we have made it so that computers "
"will give more room to darker values in the coordinate system of the image. "
"We call this 'gamma-encoding', because it is applying a gamma function to "
"the TRC or transfer function of an image. The TRC in this case being the "
"Tone Response Curve or Tone Reproduction Curve or Transfer function (because "
"color management specialists hate themselves), which tells your computer or "
"printer how much color corresponds to a certain value."

"One of the most common issues people have with Krita's color management is "

"If you look at linear of Rec. 709 TRCs, you can see there's quite a jump "
"between the darker shades and the lighter shades, while if we look at the "
"Lab L* TRC or the sRGB TRC, which seem more evenly spaced. This is due to "
"our eyes' sensitivity to darker values. This also means that if you do not "
"have enough bit depth, an image in a linear space will look as if it has "
"ugly banding. Hence why, when we make images for viewing on a screen, we "
"always use something like the Lab L\\*, sRGB or Gamma 2.2 TRCs to encode the "
