"Eye tracker devices are becoming more affordable and they are finding their "
"way into more computer setups. Although these devices are used by various "
"types of users, we will mainly focus on users who have physical disabilities "
"and can only use their eyes to interact with the computer."

"If you don't already have experience with such a case, here are a few things "
"you'll need to know before you start:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/eye_tracker.rst:33
msgid ""
"The eye tracker needs to be properly calibrated such that the pointer will "
"be very close to the point where the user is looking at. This might be "
"difficult to achieve, especially if the positioning of the eye tracker with "
"respect to the user can not be fixed between different sessions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/eye_tracker.rst:38
msgid ""
"The lack of accuracy in control makes it nearly impossible to hit small "
"areas on the screen such as small buttons or menu items. Corners and edges "
"of the screen might be difficult to reach too. You also don't want to put "
"interface elements close to one another since it increases the chances of "
"selecting the wrong element accidentally."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/eye_tracker.rst:44
msgid ""
"Mouse operations like single click, double click, right click, drag and "
"drop, etc. all demand extra effort in the form of switching modes in the "
"program that controls the device. You will want to keep these switches to a "
"minimum so that the work will not be interrupted frequently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/eye_tracker.rst:49
msgid ""
"Switching the mode doesn't automatically start the operation. You need an "
"extra action for that. In our case, this action is \"dwelling\". For "
"example, to start a program, you switch to the left double click mode and "
"then dwell on the icon for the application to activate the double click. "
"Adjusting the dwell time is an important tradeoff: shorter dwell times allow "
"for faster work but are also more error-prone."

msgid ""
"Besides the *obvious* requirement of having an eye tracker device, you will "
"also need a control program that will let you interact with the device. When "
"you obtain the device, such a program will most probably be provided to you "
"but that program might not be sufficient for using the device with Krita."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/eye_tracker.rst:65
msgid ""
"One of the basic functionalities of these programs is to emulate mouse "
"clicks. In our case, the program provides a hovering menu which includes "
"large buttons for switching modes between left/right mouse buttons and "
"single/double clicks. After selecting the mode, the hovering menu can be "
"collapsed so that it will leave more screen space for the application."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/eye_tracker.rst:71
msgid ""
"In order to make them easier to configure and use, some programs include "
"only basic modes like single clicks. This is sufficient for many popular "
"applications like e-mail agents and browsers, but for Krita you need the "
"drag and drop mode to be able to draw. If the provided control software "
"doesn't support this mode (usually called \"mouse emulation\"), you can "
"contact the manufacturer of the device for assistance, or look for open "
"source options."

"Basically, setting the control program to left double click mode and "

"but there are some issues with this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/eye_tracker.rst:86
msgid ""
"On startup, Krita asks you to choose a template. It's likely that you don't "
"want to go through this setting every time and just want to start with a "

"Later, saving the document will require interacting with the file save "

#: ../../tutorials/eye_tracker.rst:93
msgid ""
"A workaround for these issues could be creating and saving a blank template "
"and running a script that will copy this template under a new name and send "
"it to Krita. Here's an example script for Windows which uses a timestamp "
"suffix to make sure that each file will have a different name (replace "
"USERNAME with the actual user name)::"

"Double clicking on this script will create a new Krita file in the same "

"You will want to put everything you need somewhere you can easily access. "

"decided to place permanent dockers for these."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/eye_tracker.rst:148
msgid ""
"Krita features many brushes but the docker has to contain a limited number "
"of those so that the brush icons can be large enough. We recommend that you "

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/eye_tracker.rst:152
msgid ""
"There are various tools for selecting color but most of them are not easily "
"usable since they require quite a high level of mouse control. The Python "
"Palette Docker is the simplest to use where you select from a set of "
"predefined colors, similar to brush presets. Again, similarly to brush "
"selection, it will help to create a :ref:`custom set of favorite colors "
"<palette_docker>`."

#: ../../tutorials/eye_tracker.rst:158
msgid ""
"Once you are happy with your layout, another feature that will help you is "
"to lock the dockers. It's possible to accidentally close or move dockers. "

"drag it across the screen. To prevent this, put the following setting in "
